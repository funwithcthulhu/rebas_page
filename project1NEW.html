  <p class="paragraph">Reba has been adapting to her new life very well! Last spring </br>
    she got into a fight with a veritable army of scorpions, leaving her paralyzed   </br>
    from the upper waist down to the lower waist.  She takes it in stride though!    </p>

  <p class="paragraph">Poor Reba curled up in sheer agony over the paltry 14 hours </br>
     of sleep she got last night. I'm typing this extra quietly so I don't wake the </br>
     angel up. Sleep up, lil' pup.</p>

  <p class="paragraph">The vet said this might happen: the scorpion poison can </br>
    confuse the small brains of smaller mammals, leading them to see inanimate </br>
    objects as prey. Luckily the venom has worn down her teeth to basically nubs so </br>
     she can't do any damage to the computer (or herself!).</p>

  <p class="paragraph">Well, a sad update today. It seems the poison has taken </br>
    the penultimate toll: Reba's bodily has withered away and now she's basically</br>
     a mobile skull.  Suprisingly, this hasn't affected her attitude or appetite </br>
     and scoots along the carpet through sheer anxious energy</p>
